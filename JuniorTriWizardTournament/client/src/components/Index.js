                    <p>Welcome, young witches and wizards, to the Junior Tri-Wizard Tournament!</p>
                    <p>For those of you who were not chosen as champions for your respective schools, fear not, for this game is for you!
                        While the fate of the Tri-Wizard Cup may not rest on your shoulders, but your participation in these games is no less important to the magical community.</p>
                    <p>As you embark on this adventure, remember that you are representing your school: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, and the Durmstrang Institute.
                        The points you earn here will contribute to your school's standing.
                        Be couragous and clever, and above all, be true to your school.</p>
                    <p>So, let the games begin, and may the best school win!</p>
